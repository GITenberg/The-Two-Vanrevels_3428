description: Set in 1846, Mr. Carewe "brought his lovely daughter home from the convent
  to wreck the hearts of the youth of Rouen." Betty Carewe soon finds herself pursued
  by two young men--but she mistakes them for the same person. Ardent suitor Crailey
  Gray is content to let her believe that he is his rival, Tom Vanrevel.
